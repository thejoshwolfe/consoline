consoline is a GNU Readline wrapper.
- Features/Limitations:
    - Simplified interface to GNU Readline including dynamic completion.
    - Don't use stdio.h. use consoline_println() or consoline_printfln(). You
      must print entire lines a time.
    - Instead of blocking on a getter function, you poll on an interval and
      react to lines of stdin with a callback function.
    - Printing asynchronously while the user is typing a line of stdin does not
      interrupt the stdin line; it prints above it.
- The core is contained in consoline.c and consoline.h, which are ready to be
  dropped into a C or C++ project or be built into a library.
- The program 'consoline' is the main target of the Makefil and defined in
  main.c. It invokes a program and uses consoline to wrap stdin/stdout.
- There is also a test.c which uses all the consoline core features. Build it
  with 'make test'. Run ./test and press the tab key twice to see its commands.


Dependencies (Ubuntu):
