consoline wraps a program's invocation with GNU Readline and prevents
asynchronous stdout from interrupting a line of input being typed by the user.

Build (Ubuntu):
    sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
    make

Usage:
    consoline command [args]
Examples:
    consoline bash -c "sleep 3; echo hello; bash"


There is also a test.c which uses some features of consoline.c that aren't used
in main.c. Build it with 'make test'.

NOTE: if you're running python with this program, be sure to use python -u.

TODO: Ctrl+C should optionally kill current line, instead of kill the program.
